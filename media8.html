    <p>Clothes are like language, full of meaning and nuances in all shapes and sizes, colours and textures. They are one of the prevailing modes of expression. The notion that clothing as an expression of our personality belongs to one gender or another is a social construct that needs disassembling. Clothes are a language we all speak, but we do not all speak the same dialect!

        Well, “Genderless” clothing or “Gender fluid clothing” is being designed without a specific colour or texture in mind; it is simply designed to be able to fit a variety of body types, and the fashion is fluid, not inherently masculine nor feminine. It is for all and not just for those who identify as ‘male’ or ‘female’. In a world where strict gender lines and rules are blurring, genderless or androgynous fashion lets you explore your liking of fashion without having to worry about stereotypes drawn up by society. It is for people to express themselves as who they want to be.
        
        But what is the need for “Gender Fluid Fashion”? Why is it so important to talk about it in the 21st century?</p>
        <p>Pink is for girls, blue is for boys, skirts for girls, pants for boys, nail paint, jewellery, piercings, and makeup are all feminine, and the list is never-ending. They all exhibit traits of toxic masculinity, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of prejudice.

            The gender biases over fashion are not only restricted to clothing but include topics like “body hair,” too. There has always been a popular social perception that body hair is undesirable on women’s bodies while men possessing them is a sign of masculinity, which is entirely unscientific. The question arises of where these standards come from when it’s the body’s way of accessorising itself.
            
            Thus tackling all these biases, the concept of Gender neutral or Gender-fluid fashion has evolved, which regards fashion as genderless, meaning not inherently masculine or feminine, and styles that can fit all body types.</p>
            <p>Like many other gender stereotypes, gender biases over fashion have been followed for decades. Earlier, people were made to dress up conforming to gender roles, but with time, people have realised that fashion is much more than a sole binary concept. Fashion has now become a means of expressing oneself and not just a piece of clothing adhering to gender roles.

                Another example that calls for the need for gender-fluid clothing is the absence of pockets from the so-called women’s wear and, even if present, the small size making it useless, contrary to the well-spaced pockets in men’s wear. To solve the problem, the Modern Fashion Industry came up with the idea of focusing on the product and its utility rather than its gender.
                
                How has gender-neutral clothing helped various communities?</p>
                <p>The concept of gender-neutral fashion in itself is so inclusive that it not only accounts for the problem of “ pants being masculine and skirts being feminine” but also gives trans-gender people, people with body and gender dysmorphia, nonbinary individuals, and all the other folks on the sexuality spectrum a feeling of belongingness to the mainstream society, where they can express their true-self, without the fear of judgment and being out-casted. With the growing popularity of gender-neutral fashion, many people find it liberating to express their identity and confidently be who they are.

                    It should be noted that it is inappropriate to label somebody as progressive based on their attire since it is a classist remark. The fact that a girl is referred to as a progressive person when she wears jeans, a shirt, or any other such so-called “masculine clothing” in contrast to a man who tries to wear a skirt in public or put on makeup is compelling evidence that should not be mistaken for gender fluidity in regards to fashion. Gender-fluid fashion cannot be categorised under this double standard of pretended gender neutrality. The terrible aspect is that most nations, including India, are experiencing this.</p>
                    <p>The major problem is not the lack of awareness but the unwillingness to adapt to changing times. People not abiding by the gender binary don’t need to change their appearance to make other people comfortable or to conform to their set rules. And to be ‘’oneself’’ is not just an act of bravery but honesty, a fierce commitment to individuality even in the face of societal, political, and social repression.

                        Looking at the generation of the hour, The GenZ, and how creators and celebrities are influencing them, gender-fluid fashion has a promising future. Famous icons like Harry Styles, Ranveer Singh, Zendaya, Troy Sivan, and many more are smashing gender norms and becoming pioneers for the present and upcoming generations. The role of Content creators, Fashion brands, and startups in this revolution is also worth mentioning.</p>
                        <p>We still have miles to go, but with social media and social awareness around this topic, the audience is becoming more vocal about what they stand for. Gen-Z is now embracing gender-neutral outfits and normalising the culture of gender fluidity, making it better and more accessible for the person scrolling on the other side of the phone and bringing up the confidence among people to believe in who they are!
