    <p>The given still is from the latest release of Marvel Studios Spider-Man No Way Home, the third installment of the franchise. It depicts the moment when Peter Parker, played by Tom Holland has already sealed his fate. He asked Doctor Strange to cast his spell and erase everyone’s memories of him as Peter Parker so that the Spider-Men, Green Goblin, Doctor Octavius, Lizard, Sandman, Electro and incoming variants would return to their respective universes.

        Feeling guilty and remorse after the brutal death of Aunt May by the hands of Green Goblin, Peter was approached by the two Spider-Men accompanied by his girlfriend Michelle Jones and best friend Ned Leeds. The two Peter Parkers then narrate their tragedy as Spider-Men.</p>
        <p>Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield, expressed how much he despised himself for not being able to save the love of his life-Gwen Stacy. Her death was his fault. Nothing he did could ever change that. He had almost given up on being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, but he didn’t. Things did get dark; he got vengeful, he even started pulling his punches but never backed away from his responsibility in order to honor the memories of his deceased love.

            Peter Parker played by Tobey Maguire reflects his regret on how he treated Uncle Ben during their last conversation ever, by talking back on him saying Ben isn’t his father. Peter’s eyes clearly show even after all these years of being Spider-Man and saving people, he couldn’t forgive himself for what he had done. No matter what he could do, Uncle Ben was not coming back. It took him a long time to get through it. He got all he wanted, but nothing would ever make it better.</p>
            <p>But there was one thing in common for all three of them. The day they lost the most important person to them, their last words were that with great power, comes great responsibility. Tom’s Peter is baﬄed to know this happened with both of them and then Tobey’s Peter assures him that Aunt May didn’t die for nothing.

                In moments of darkness, in the moments when we see everything is lost, family is all we can rely on. There is always a family out there to find you and look after you during the moments you need them, to guide you when you are lost and to protect you when you are in danger. Tom’s Peter just lost the only family he ever had, but the presence of other Peter Parkers gave him the support he needed with the assurance he isn’t alone. Tom’s Peter found a brotherhood among the two Spider- Men which comforted his mind and soul.</p>
                <p>Tobey Maguire’s Peter, being the eldest Peter and the wisest having went through more than enough shares his experience and tries to guide the other Peter Parkers while supporting Tom Holland’s Peter to help make a cure for Norman Osborn. While working on lab, he bonded with Andrew’s Peter how he is settled in his life, and has time for both Peter Parker and Spider-Man stuff, while the latter didn’t. Just like a brother seeing Andrew’s Peter’s morale vanishing before their battle he called him “Amazing” to keep his spirit and motivation high. He went as far as to prevent Tom’s Peter from killing Norman Osborn, to stop him from going down the same path of darkness he went through.

                    Andrew’s Peter, the middle brother, still not over Gwen but tries his best to be the best version of himself. He looks up to Tobey with a sense of respect like a role-model to be like him. He agreed to fix Tobey’s back like any younger brother would, even getting jealous by the fact he didn’t get to fight an alien while the other two did. He doesn’t shy to express his love to the two Peters, proving they are already a family. Seeing MJ falling from the Statue when Tom’s Peter was whisked away by Goblin, he rushes in rescue to save her to make sure the Tom’s Peter doesn’t suffer the same aftermath as his.</p>
                    <p>So when Doctor Strange was about to reverse the spell that was tearing the entire multiverse apart bringing other variants, Peter’s last wish was to wipe the memories of him existing in the universe. Strange agrees and he goes straight to visit his two brothers, Spider-Men. He hugs them showing gratitude for helping him save all the villains, staying by him during the brutal fight saving his friends. He finally found the true meaning of being a hero. He found his purpose, all it needed was an influence of the Spider-Men from other universes.

                        The entire story arc would be very incomplete without this one scene. It would have been very selfish of Tom if he hadn’t gone to them to thank them. Or if Tobey’s and Andrew’s Peter simply disappeared without getting to see Tom’s Peter, it wouldn’t feel like a closure. The sense of brotherhood would have departed were it not for the moment of three Spider-Men embracing each other. This one still added a lot of character and emotion in one still.</p>
                        <p>The villains he tried saving turned their back and took everything from him. The civilians he saved dreaded him. DODC fired at him and he lost his aunt. In this dark moment, he needed them. They saved him from his loneliness and pain. He was weak. Being with them made him strong enough to fight the world alone. This was the moment Tom’s Spider-Man became free of Stark Technologies, sacrificed his existence for the sake of his friends and loved ones. He started all over again. Tom’s Peter went from a selfish teenage kid to a grown up boy who accepted his curse, who finally understood what it means to be Spider-Man.

                            “Tragedies can happen, it’ll be unexpected, but don’t let it end the journey you have and you were meant to have.”
