    <p>In the age of romcoms, kissing has become a staple: when the lovers finally confess their true feelings for each other, the music swells, the camera pans both of them into view, and they share a moment of intimacy that’s a universal symbol of romance. At this point, the audience all but expects a grand kiss at the end of a romantic movie and can feel a sense of emptiness when there is no such moment.

        We truly have come a long way from the 90s. Not the 1990s, no, the long road for the on-screen kiss began in the 1890s! The 1896 film, aptly titled The Kiss, was an 18-second re-enactment of the kiss between May Irwin and John Rice, taken from the final scene of the stage musical The Widow Jones. Produced by Thomas Edison, The Kiss received widespread backlash, especially from the Roman Catholic Church. Critics and newspaper editorials considered The Kiss a scandal, with one critic going as far as saying: “The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other’s lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting.”</p>
        <p>According to modern historians, however, the general public did not feel the same. At the time, kissing in public could lead to prosecution. Audiences who saw the film most probably felt a sense of liberation and glee, rather than disgust. Soon after its release, a number of inspired films took off, including Something Good (1898) which included the first-ever African-American kiss on screen, The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899), and The Kiss (1990). The Edison Catalogue advertised the original film as “They get ready to kiss, begin to kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss in a way that brings down the house every time.”

            There is, however, a twist in the tale. If you know anything about Edison, the moment you hear the words “Edison did it first”, you know it’s fishy.</p>
            <p>Enter Eadweard Muybridge. The man responsible for a number of famous motion pictures, including the galloping horse or explorations of the human condition. Manual labour. Reading a newspaper. Smoking a cigarette. Drinking a cup of tea. Dancing. And… Kissing!

                What was so special about Murbridge’s works? Well, it was a couple of things. For one, he revolutionised the art of motion pictures. In the 1890s, camera shutter speeds were only as fast as a second or half a second. Muybridge pioneered in this field using cameras that went off by a tripwire, taking multiple photos at close intervals of time. This technique was so ingenious that it increased the shutter speed to 1/60th of a second, and was used in the iconic Bullet Time sequence in The Matrix movies!</p>
                <p>Another special, although somewhat ethically muddy, detail about Muybridge’s photography was the use of servants as models. Many of the actors featured in his films were indentured labourers, or workers living on poverty wages, and especially interesting to our story: women who acted as helpers to Muybridge’s sponsors.

                    As a result of using servants or slaves as models, Muybridge’s films included studies of the human anatomy, paired with the culture of the time. Most of the time, the actors were almost fully in the nude, except sometimes wearing a hat or a cane. And, central to our original question: he filmed the first ever kiss, between two women.
                    
                    The situation begs a number of questions: why isn’t this well known? Why is it that the world still generally believes that the first kiss was between May Irwin and John Rice? Why is Muybridge’s work never even mentioned, while Edison is considered a pioneer?</p>
                    <p>Why don’t we even know the names of the two kissing women? A film, that would cause controversy if it was released in 2023, was somehow forgotten in the 1890s?

                        The answer is less conspiratorial and more mundane. In the times of Muybridge, women were hardly considered autonomous. They were so deeply dependent on the men, that any action of independence they may enact was thought of to be infantile. If two women kissed, it wasn’t something to be paid attention to. It might as well be two planks of wood making contact.
                        
                        This is perhaps the larger point here. It means something significant when we see people become enraged with progressive ideas. The fact that people are getting angry, the fact that they are actively opposing progress, means that they are taking a movement seriously. In the words of Union Leader Nicholas Klein:
                        
                        “First, they ignore you. Then, they ridicule you. And then, they attack you and want to burn you. And then, they build monuments for you.”</p>
                        <p>This takes us back to the two women, the stars of the world’s first cinematic kiss. They were first ignored, not even considered human. Then, the generations after them were ridiculed as “dykes” or “queer”. Then, they were attacked: from shootings to conversion therapy to legislative action against them. And finally, after two centuries of ignorance, the films are being uncovered. The monuments made for the two women always existed since the day they kissed on that day in the European Sun. The only thing we can do is recognise them for their beauty.
