    <h1>What is FMC?</h1>
    <p>Varanasi is the epitome of cultural heritage, diversity, art, and pure energy. And situated at the heart of Varanasi lies IIT BHU along with its Film and Media Council, which represents the creative side of the nerdy tech peeps at IIT BHU. It is a joint of six clubs: Cinematography, Photography, Media, Design, Animation and Outreach. With a plethora of exciting events, workshops and active participation year-round, it encourages a lively visual art culture among the talented students of IIT BHU.</p>
    <h1>What is FMC Weekend?</h1>
    <p>To further inculcate and celebrate this creative process, it organizes a weekend full of extravaganza, the FMC Weekend. It is India’s largest digital arts festival, a yearly congregation of artists who unite to celebrate each other’s creative ability. Packed with a lot of enlightening workshops by notable experts in their fields and fun-filled evenings with crowd-favourite entertainers, its joyful aura is unmatchable. Competitions, with amazing awards, are held in every creative domain, including cine, photography, media, design, animation and social outreach to tell the world it is not only tech we excel at! With glowing sunshine starting to emerge out of the receding winters, bringing a bloom of vibrant colours, FMC Weekend’23 arrives at the brink of spring every year.</p>
    <h1>What happens at the Weekend?</h1>
    <p>With Weekend comes a wave of awe-inspiring pronites, informative workshops and competitions with well-thought prompts. Talented people from around the country, come together and participate against each other, in presence of judges who are at the top of their fields. Amidst the competition, beautiful and unique pieces of art crop up, mesmerizing the crowd.

        Pronites are one of the most awaited evenings of the weekend. In the previous editions we were tickled by comedian Shashwat Maheshwari, inspired by the poetry of Atmandeep Khyal, and jaw-dropped by the magic of mentalist Preveen Pandita.
        
        Workshops rejuvenate the creative prowess of students. FMC Weekend invites artists who are at the top of their fields to share their mantra for success with young talents. Some of the notable workshops from last year include the filmmaking workshop by Ritam Bhatnagar, the UI/UX workshop by Rishav Jain, a creative writing workshop by Nikita Singh and a photography masterclass by renowned wildlife photographer, Rathika Ramaswamy.</p>
        <h1>How did the FMC and the Weekend begin?</h1>
        <p>Let’s travel back to the days of yore! In 2012 (we know it sounds ridiculous to call 2012 the days of yore, but with the illustrious history that FMC has, it certainly does seem a long time ago) a group of visionary individuals and stalwarts comprising of KT bhaiya, Laxman Teja bhaiya, Jatin bhaiya and more decided to form a council for the marvellous thing that is digital arts. Thence, the Film and Media Council comprising of Photography Club, Cine Club, Media Club, Design Club and Animation Club was formed.

            To satisfy the curiosity of those asking where was Outreach Club during this period, here’s an interesting anecdote. The FMC helm decided that two stalwarts, both worthy of a leadership position based on their contributions and capabilities, should obtain one. However, there was only one Photography club. To create another leadership position, an additional Social Outreach club aimed at acquainting the external world about IIT BHU with interesting video tid-bits of our college, was created and the position of Secretary of both clubs was decided on a coin toss. And that’s how Kshitij bhaiya became the secretary of the Photography club while Darshan bhaiya became the first secretary of the Outreach Club.
            
            Realizing that the council was working very hard to cover other festivals, a group of people (including future Gen Sec Shashwat Tripathi bhaiya) came up with the idea of having something of ourselves, possibly a festival of digital arts that the council can conduct for themselves and the entire college can truly enjoy; something for IIT BHU, something For My College. And that’s how the inception of For My College Weekend, abbreviated as FMC Weekend, happened in 2014.
            
            This kickstarted a line of eight wonderful editions of FMC Weekend which carried us forward into this ninth edition. With each edition came a plethora of fun and a ton of learnings. Let’s take a look at each edition!</p>
