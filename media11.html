    <p>‘Please don’t let them do anything to her!’ pleaded Anna. ‘Don’t worry. I won’t let them lay a finger on your sister’, replied Prince Hans. Royalty seldom took heart to paupers like Anna. However, there was something different about Prince Hans. He fell for Anna just within two days of his visit. The inception of their engagement was merely an inch away. Who knew it was going to be interrupted by Elsa’s incident?</p>
    <p>Elsa and Anna were destitute middle-aged orphaned girls in Arendelle. Anna wasn’t any different from the many girls that scraped for food in the cold streets of the nation. Elsa, though, was unique. She was cursed with the ability to create ice and snow, which she found difficult to control. Prince Hans of the Northern Isles was visiting Arendelle and had taken a fancy for Anna. They were touring the docks together when they heard thunder followed by jeers. ‘Freak!’, ‘Monster!’, ‘Witch’ went the citizens of Arendelle. They were raging at Esla, who had accidentally frozen a yoghurt shop. Anna rushed to defend her sister, but Elsa, panicked as she was, froze Anna’s heart. Overwhelmed, Elsa took the undertaker’s horse and fled. As her horse galloped across the bridge, large dark clouds covered Arendelle, and a sudden cold fell over the nation.</p>
    <p>The People, after long deliberation, concluded that the sudden winter was Elsa’s doing, and to stop it, they would have to kill her. Prince Hans accompanied the troops of Arendelle on a quest to subdue Elsa, leaving behind Anna while promising her that he wouldn’t let any harm befall her. Anna was not convinced and took to herself to ride towards Elsa and make her stop the winter. Despite her aching heart, she rode on towards Anna, determined to defend her sister from any hostilities. Cold as ice as she was, Anna fell unconscious on the way.

        A gruff iceman named Kristoff was passing by. On finding Anna’s ailing body, he picked her up and placed her gently on his sleigh. He assessed Anna’s situation and decided to take her to the trolls.</p>
        <p>‘Where are you taking me? I won’t forgive this. You know I’m not just anyone anymore. I’m about to become a Princess. Prince Hans will know about this!’ protested Elsa.<br>

            ‘Well then, where is your Prince Hans now that you’re trembling?’ Kristoff replied.<br>
            
            ‘He’s on a quest to bring back my sister and restore summer to Arendelle. ’ answered Anna.<br>
            
            ‘Too bad then. Now you’ll have to come with me to see about this cold of yours.’ said Kristoff.</p>
            <p>The trolls welcomed both of them with much delight. Little did Anna know that Kristoff was orphaned just like her and was raised by the trolls, whom he now considered family. Grand Pabbie, the eldest troll and a sage in magical circumstances, placed his hands on Anna’s heart and gasped. He took a step back and sunk his head in his arms. After a minute’s contemplation, he said, ‘Dear girl… you’ve been subjected to strange magic. Your frozen heart can be thawed only by an act that can bring control of its magic to the bearer of this curse. An act of true love.’

                ‘Prince Hans!’ exclaimed Anna. ‘Prince Hans’ kiss!’</p>
                <p>Kristoff immediately mounted his reindeer Sven and gave his hand to Anna to do the same. He rushed to carry Anna to Prince Hans to get Anna her true love’s kiss without wasting a second. The hooves of the troops were disappeared in the remains of the snowy blizzard. Unaware of the path he should travel, Kristoff gently stroked clever Sven and said, ‘Alright buddy, I’m blind here. Put that sharp nose of yours to work and take us to Hans’. Sven produced a loud neigh and turned around. He then paced as fast as the wind, oblivious of the blizzard and snowfall.

                    Sven’s tremendous speed brought them to the scene just in time. The troops were on their way to capture Elsa, who had made a stronghold for herself in the mountains. Sven cut across Prince Hans’ convoy and stopped in front of his horse.
                    <br>
                    ‘Prince Hans! Prince Hans!’ cried Kristoff, unmounting the horse. ‘Anna is sick! She needs your help!’ ‘Clear the way’, Hans commanded his soldiers.</p>
                    <p>‘Prince Hans! Elsa has frozen Anna’s heart. Only an act of true love can thaw her heart. A true love’s kiss. Your kiss!’ said Hans, carrying a feeble Anna in his arms towards the Prince. He gently let her down placed her in Hans’ arms. <br>

                        Prince Hans grabbed Anna and leaned in to kiss her. As he locked his lips in Anna’s, her hair turned white, and she felt a surge of weakness across her body so strong that she fell on her knees. Hans’ kiss didn’t work. It wasn’t a true love’s kiss. <br>
                        
                        ‘But… but… Grand Pabbie said…’ stammered Kristoff ‘…that it would heal Anna. Grand Pabbie is never wrong. Why wouldn’t it work?’</p>
                        <p>‘Maybe I never really loved Anna. What would a wealthy prince like me have to do with a penniless nobody like Anna? It was her sister I wanted. It is her sister I still want. The people of Arendelle were too foolish to realise that a powerful cursed individual lived in their threadbare streets. And even when they did realise it, their first instinct was to kill her. Elsa’s abilities are extraordinary. Imagine what the Northern Isles could do with her powers. We would have the most powerful weapon in our possession.’ replied Prince Hans.

                            Startled at Prince Hans’ confession, Kristoff leapt at Prince Hans and grabbed him by the collar as his soldiers pushed him back. ‘Tie the iceman and put him on the horse at the back. Bring the girl to me. I have plans for her.’ Hans ordered. His soldiers obeyed.</p>
                            <p>As they reached Elsa’s stronghold, Prince Hans took hold of Anna and pointed a crossbow at her. ‘Elsa, Prince Hans of the Nothern Isles orders you to come out of the fort you built for yourself. If you fail to comply with these instructions, I shall end your sister.’ shouted Prince Hans. Elsa appeared from behind the icy walls and submitted herself to the Prince. Just as he was about to tie her, she hurled an icicle on him, which pierced his shoulder, leaving him yelling in agony. Enraged by Elsa’s attack, he pointed his crossbow at her and released an arrow. Anna jumped in front of Elsa to block her from the shot. The arrow got buried in her heart, rendering Anna safe from harm. However, instead of her chest turning bloody, the wound started to heal itself, and the arrow fell out. Her hair, which had turned white, got restored to her regular auburn colour. The dark clouds started to disappear. The snowfall stopped, and the sun revealed itself. Anna’s attempt to save Elsa was an act of true love that not only thawed her heart but also lifted Elsa’s curse and brought control to her abilities.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, Sven had rescued Kristoff, and they were back in Arendelle, explaining to the King the evil plans of Prince Hans. The King had then sent another set of troops to apprehend the Prince for treason, and they had reached the scene just in time. Prince Hans was imprisoned, and Elsa was given the King’s Medal and a substantial reward for the trouble brought upon her.
